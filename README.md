+ Project summary: Machine learning fairness has become a critical topic when it comes to evaluating data that may result in biased results due to  sensitive attributes such as race, gender, creed, socioeconomic status, and more.  Our study compares two different algorithms, Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment and Fairness-aware Classification with Prejudice Remover Regularizer (PR), to discover which results in higher accuracy (reduced bias due to disparate treatment and disparate impact).
